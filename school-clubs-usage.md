## [A0] General Etiquette

Generally, the rules for General Ettiquette don't vary much across most places. This boils down to: **Don't ruin the place for the next guy.**

### [A1] Food and Drink Policy

Generally, the SAC is open to having Student Clubs have their own food and drink inside of the SAC's Open activity area.
However, keep in mind the following policies regarding the consumption of food and drink inside the SAC:

- Sweet drinks, if spilled, are to be cleaned up **immediately**. There are rags in the SAC that are available for this purpose. Clean up messes promptly and wash the rags after.
- Packet food may be consumed in the SAC, but must be properly bagged and disposed of once finished: That also means keeping any dustbins used to store such trash closed.
- Finger food is fine too, but remember to sweep up the crumbs! If the crumbs are hard to reach, there is also a vacuum cleaner generously donated by Energy Club.

### [A2] Keeping Things Clean

Every term, if you have used the Student Activities Centre, you are expected as a member of the community to help with the termly clean-up activity that will take place over the first week after the term's final exams are over.

Not doing so means that if space is in need in the SAC, your student club is more likely to be asked to vacate your current premises, especially if other clubs are committed to improving the space.

For the sake of keeping SAC pleasant for all users, please take note of the following reminders regarding SAC use:

- The Vacuum Cleaner is _not_ for liquids. Please wipe those up with the rags or paper napkins. If you need a reminder on what those are, [you may cick here.](https://redmart.com/search/paper%20towels "Just a reminder, you know")
- Please empty the bin if it is full when you are using it, or at the end of the day. We don't have a pest problem, and we can all work to keep it that way.
- Please do use the Vacuum cleaner and other available things for cleaning up your messes.
  - If the Vacuum cleaner is not working well, please help to clear the filter bag, or wash it, if you're a kind soul.

## [B0] Storing Items

Generally, the rules fundamentally remain the same across either people or clubs - if you want to store items, you need to provide:

1. An inventorized inventory list - it need not contain everything you are moving in, but everything of value should be within.
2. A definite start and end dates for your storage - right now, after each term space is up for review. You will also need to provide a "throw-by" date, after which removal of these items will be at the representatives' sole decision.
3. Contact details for the person-in-charge for your items.

## [C0] Booking the SAC for Activities

Right now, the SAC is a space that is free for all to use - but Student Clubs may place bookings for the space, which lets them take priority for use of the space for a certain number of hours a week, subject to representatives' approval. Contact your represenative to book timeslots for the room!

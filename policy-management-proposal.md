## Motivations

### Historical Precedence

The Student Activities Centre, also known as the SAC, was originally envisioned as a space for students' use when we first relocated from the Dover campus.

In its initial iterations, 
 SAC first envisioned as a space for students. Held concerts last time
 Became a storage space due to lack of maintenance and stakeholder management
 '18 cleaned up and maintained by students henceforth.

### Student Need

 Pi-Lab issues
 
 Project space needs
 
 Ad-hoc meeting space
 
 Temporary storage location
 

## Policy Framework

### Guiding Principles

The SAC is user-driven.

Use of the SAC is a shared responsibility and space:
1. The SAC is driven by the needs of its users.
2. Users of the space are expected to know its rules and processes.
3. Frequent users are expected to contribute to the upkeep of the space.
4. The SAC is shared amongst everyone who wants to use it.

:::info
When the SAC was first being transformed into the space it is today, clubs who actively contributed towards the cleanup of the space were given priority for the use of the space after, leading to the situation today.
:::

These are our guiding principles:
1. Transparency
    - All policies will be openly available in a public repository.
    - Policies are open to review by any stakeholder.
    - All policy enforcement will be done openly.
2. Inclusivity
    - all key stakeholders consulted
    - communication channels established and kept open
3. Accountability
    - every processes leading to decisions should be traceable
    - every decision made justifiable

### Stakeholders

We are always beholden to the policy of the school, as we exist on school grounds. We understand that management of the Student Activities Centre is a privilege provided to us by the Provost.

We are responsible to our users, and those who frequently upkeep the space. We understand that the space belongs to no single party, and that the space must accomodate those who have need of it, wherever possible.

As this is a student managed space, the SAC reps are arbiters. Cluster Reps?

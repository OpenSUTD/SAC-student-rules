## Applying to Use the Space

The process for applying for the use of the Student Activities Centre is relatively straightforward. It involves, basically, 4 different steps:

1. Submit in writing the following details about your request for the use of the space:
   1. What you are intending to use the space for
   2. When you intend to use the space (start, end, disposal dates)
      - Note: disposal dates are to be within a month of the end date, barring special dispensation.
   3. What kinds of items you are intending to use the space with (with an inventory list)
   4. Contact details of the person in charge of this use of space
2. E-mail your request to either the Arts/Social Cluster Representative or the Specialist/Maker Cluster Representative. (that's [social(at)rep.sutd.edu.sg] or [arts(at)rep.sutd.edu.sg])
3. Receive your approval in writing, along with what space you have been allocated.
4. Use the space responsibly.

## Maintaining your Space

Every term, if you have used the Student Activities Centre, you are expected as a member of the community to help with the termly clean-up activity that will take place over the first week after the term's final exams are over.

## Common FAQ

**Q: What happens if I don't remove my items by the end date?**

A: You will get 1 notification through whichever contact means that your items are due and that you should remove them. You will receive another notification on the date of disposal, failure to act upon which will result in your items being thrown out and your name being put on a blacklist.

**Q: What if I don't need permanent storage but only desk space?**

A: The same applies as above.

## Donating Items

If you wish to donate goods to the Student Activities Centre, please let the cluster representatives know before donating - and please note that **just because you donate does not mean that you will have space.** Donated goods are for the use of all students who use the SAC daily, and not just for the donors. Whenever you donate items, they will _permanently_ become part of the SAC for the representatives to manage.

Representatives hold the right to refuse donations if they feel that the items are not suited to the SAC.

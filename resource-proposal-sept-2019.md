# SAC Roadmap Sept 2019

**AKA: What do we do with the SAC?**

This document outlines a roadmap of developments planned for the Student Activities Centre, focused around three major thrusts:

1. Improving access to key-locked rooms
2. Increasing available space for users
3. Providing facilities for student clubs

## Changelog

### December 2019 Update

OSL has notified that certain things are simply not feasible to undertake:

- Faucet-sink replacement
- Re-levelling of power sources
- Expansion of number of power sources
- Purchase of additional reusable lockers (More lockers have been provisioned for instead.)

## Why Now

Prior to this, the SAC has had a fair share of problems:

- Legacy mess everywhere
- Grey-area authority
- Poor maintenance

Since the initial cleanup in November 2018, there has been a progressive and growing body of work and precedents which has built into place a framework by which the SAC may function.

This also means that the time is ripe for a full review of processes and for a roadmap for development of the SAC.

## Overview of Developments

This roadmap can primarily be divided into two larger chunks:

1. Necessary changes to improve the state of the SAC and move it into good working condition
2. Proposed improvements to better suit the SAC's three major goals.

### Necessary Changes

In this section, we outline some key features that are necessary to restore the SAC into a good working condition.

#### Shelving and Storage Solutions

At the current, key-locked rooms are currently used as storage spaces for clubs. This is not expected to change in the immediate future as part of the agreement made with student clubs for their assistance in cleaning up the legacy mess.

The SAC has need for additional shelving if any of the locked rooms are to be used as Student Clubs' storage spaces and work spaces, as current space utilization is inefficient.

#### Shelving Racks in Rooms

To improve the efficiency of storage in the locked rooms and in the open areas, we propose the following shelving solutions be purchased:

- Metal racked shelving with metallic platforms:
  - Minimum height of 150cm
  - At least 3 platforms
  - Must be tileable
  - Proposed Budget: \$120 per rack

These shelves should also have backing that can either be mounted onto the support structure or installed by users with little effort. Additionally, mounting points for a dust screen should also be made available.

Care should also be taken to ensure that the racks may be shifted around for users, and if bolted together should be removable with minimal effort on the part of users.

> **Addendum Dec 2019**
>
> We have been informed by OSL that shelving racks have been purchased, and are being made generally available once the finalized area management plan is done.

#### Lockers and Secured Storage

For users of the SAC that may not have access to the key-locked rooms, lockable storage should be made available for users to store items securely between workdays.

**Removed: Check addendum below.**

<!--
- Metal/Plastic lockers
  - Minimum volume of 30cm (width) by 40cm (depth) by 40cm (height)
  - Should be configurable with master key override
  - Proposed Budget: \$200 per locker bank
  - Metal preferred
  - Combinable lockers preferred
-->

The current locker solutions should be refurbished to support reprogrammable locks that can be reset with either a master key or while open.

Otherwise, if not possible, spare keys should be made available.

> **Addendum**
>
> We have been informed that OSL has refurbished all of the existing lockers for now, and that current budgetary constraints do not allow for the purchase of new lockers, especially since the Spacebar is being closed. Lockers from Spacebar will be used to augment current storage instead.

### Facilities Refurbishment

Over years of use and misuse, several parts of the SAC have fallen into disrepair. These include critical infrastructure segments, like the electrical system and plumbing.

#### Electrical Supply

Most of the electrical plugs that are installed in the recesses of the floor have become unusable. They are either too loose to be safe to operate, or are entirely dead - making finding electrical supplies reliant on multi-plugs and the few sockets that are still usable.

Hence, a full electrical overhaul of the space is needed. All of the electrical sockets need to be repaired to their original state, and the recessed spaces need to be cleaned out, with additional sockets installed to capacity.

This means that each electrical recess space should have the following:

- ~~Four (4) fully-functional electrical sockets, fitted for UK plugs~~ **See Addendum below**
- ~~Recess covers should not bulge when a standard laptop plug is inserted.~~ **See Addendum below**
- All sockets must be rigid.

> **Addendum Dec 2019**
>
> We have been informed by ENGIE maintenance that the modifications to the floor are not possible, since doing so would require tearing up the entire flooring to rebuild the space. They have however agreed to test and refresh all of the electrial mains and tighten up the sockets.

#### Plumbing

At the current, both water pressure and drainage are lackluster in the SAC. As such, the following measures are proposed:

- ~~Faucet should be mounted in a recess that is at least 5mm lower than the countertop.~~
- ~~Faucet recess should have a countertop area that has the same open surface area as the sink.~~
- ~~Faucet should be able to fill a 1L bottle in 5 seconds or less.~~ **See Addendum Below**
- Drainage sink should be cleared.

> **Addendum Dec 2019**
>
> ENGIE maintenance has informed us that replacing the faucet and sink is impractical as it requires tearing out the entirety of the kitchenette island. They have instead repaired what they could with the water pressure and the faucet.

#### Wants

1. A better and more accessible method of verifying users and automatically allowing keys to be released without the precence of the people in charge of SAC
2.

#### Needs

1. More shelving
2. More cleaning
3. More responsibility -->

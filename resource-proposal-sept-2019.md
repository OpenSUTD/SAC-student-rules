# SAC Roadmap Sept 2019

**AKA: What do we do with the SAC?**

This document outlines a roadmap of developments planned for the Student Activities Centre, focused around three major thrusts:

1. Improving access to key-locked rooms
2. Increasing available space for users
3. Providing facilities for student clubs

## Why Now?

Prior to this, the SAC has had a fair share of problems:

* Legacy mess everywhere
* Grey-area authority
* Poor maintenance 

But since the initial cleanup in June 2018, there has been a progressive and growing body of work and precedents which has built into place a framework by which the SAC may function.

This also means that the time is ripe for a full review of processes and for a roadmap for development of the SAC.

## Overview of Developments

This roadmap can primarily be divided into two larger chunks:

1. Necessary changes to improve the state of the SAC and move it into good working condition
2. Proposed improvements to better suit the SAC's three major goals.

### Necessary Changes

In this section, we outline some key features that are necessary to restore the SAC into a good working condition.

#### Shelving and Storage Solutions

At the current, key-locked rooms are currently used as storage spaces for clubs. This is not expected to change in the immediate future as part of the agreement made with student clubs for their assistance in cleaning up the legacy mess.

The SAC has need for additional shelving if any of the locked rooms are to be used as Student Clubs' storage spaces and work spaces, as current space utilization is inefficient.

# SAC Roadmap Sept 2019

**AKA: What do we do with the SAC?**

This document outlines a roadmap of developments planned for the Student Activities Centre, focused around three major thrusts:

1. Improving access to key-locked rooms
2. Increasing available space for users
3. Providing facilities for student clubs

## Why Now?

Prior to this, the SAC has had a fair share of problems:

- Legacy mess everywhere
- Grey-area authority
- Poor maintenance

Since the initial cleanup in November 2018, there has been a progressive and growing body of work and precedents which has built into place a framework by which the SAC may function.

This also means that the time is ripe for a full review of processes and for a roadmap for development of the SAC.

## Overview of Developments

This roadmap can primarily be divided into two larger chunks:

1. Necessary changes to improve the state of the SAC and move it into good working condition
2. Proposed improvements to better suit the SAC's three major goals.

### Necessary Changes

In this section, we outline some key features that are necessary to restore the SAC into a good working condition.

#### Shelving and Storage Solutions

At the current, key-locked rooms are currently used as storage spaces for clubs. This is not expected to change in the immediate future as part of the agreement made with student clubs for their assistance in cleaning up the legacy mess.

The SAC has need for additional shelving if any of the locked rooms are to be used as Student Clubs' storage spaces and work spaces, as current space utilization is inefficient.

#### Shelving Racks in Rooms

To improve the efficiency of storage in the locked rooms and in the open areas, we propose the following shelving solutions be purchased:

- Metal racked shelving with metallic platforms:
  - Minimum height of 150cm
  - At least 3 platforms
  - Must be tileable
  - Proposed Budget: \$120 per rack

These shelves should also have backing that can either be mounted onto the support structure or installed by users with little effort. Additionally, mounting points for a dust screen should also be made available.

Care should also be taken to ensure that the racks may be shifted around for users, and if bolted together should be removable with minimal effort on the part of users.

#### Lockers and Secured Storage

For users of the SAC that may not have access to the key-locked rooms, lockable storage should be made available for users to store items securely between workdays.

- Metal/Plastic lockers
  - Minimum volume of 30cm (width) by 40cm (depth) by 40cm (height)
  - Should be configurable with master key override
  - Proposed Budget: \$200 per locker bank
  - Metal preferred
  - Combinable lockers preferred

The current locker solutions should be refurbished to support reprogrammable locks that can be reset with either a master key or while open.

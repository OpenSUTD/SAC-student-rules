# SAC Roadmap, Sept 2019

**AKA: What do we do with the SAC?**

This document outlines a roadmap of developments planned for the Student Activities Centre, focused around three major thrusts:

1. Improving access to key-locked rooms
2. Increasing available space for users
3. Providing facilities for student clubs

## Why Now?

Prior to this, the SAC has had a fair share of problems:

* Legacy mess everywhere
* Grey-area authority
* Poor maintenance 

But since the initial cleanup in June 2018, there has been a progressive and growing body of work and precedents which has built into place a framework by which the SAC may function.

This also means that the time is ripe for a full review of processes and for a roadmap for development of the SAC.
